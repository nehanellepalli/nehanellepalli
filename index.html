           <h2> Hello, I'm Neha, a passionate web developer with experience in crafting engaging and user-friendly websites. My journey in the realm of web development began with a curiosity-driven exploration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I honed my skills in front-end development, mastering frameworks like React.js and Vue.js to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.Collaborating with others, picking up tips from colleagues, and making contributions to open-source projects have all enhanced my developmental path. I do best in settings that encourage innovation, creativity, and lifelong learning. In addition to coding, I have a strong interest in user experience design and work hard to provide engaging digital experiences for people.</h2>
